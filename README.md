# Numinosum

Numinosum is a mobile app for collecting and organizing book excerpts taken from physical books. It allows you to take pictures of book pages, crop the excerpts you are interrested in and perform OCR so you don't have to rewrite them by hand.

Built with Ionic 5 in React. Uses [react-image-crop](https://github.com/DominicTobias/react-image-crop) for image cropping and [tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js) for OCR.
